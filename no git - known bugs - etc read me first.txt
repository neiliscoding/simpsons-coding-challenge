Started this project in a rush and glossed over the need for git.

All is not lost, I have zipped previous iterations 2 to 8.

There is also a random quote generator that I made first in order to get a working front end prototype to check my back end list retrieval was working.

Known bugs;

On the second time you edit a character it updates the previous character edit with the new information.

On the second time you submit an edit, multiple homers are appended to the page.

No unit testing, since its been over 5 years since I've worked with spring I spent around half my alloted 48 development time on developing the backend and did not have time to implement unit testing.

If you would like to see unit testing I can spend more time on this.
